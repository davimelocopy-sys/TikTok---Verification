# Legal Operations Diagnosis

## Overview

This skill provides a comprehensive framework for diagnosing operational inefficiencies, bottlenecks, and hidden costs in law firm operations. It maps the complete journey from client intake to financial closure, identifying pain points that impact profitability, client satisfaction, and team productivity.

## Core Principles

### Individual Assessment Model

- **Each firm generates a unique, isolated diagnosis** - No cross-firm comparisons during collection
- **Privacy-first architecture** - Responses are never aggregated or analyzed collectively at intake
- **Reusable template, unique instances** - Same questionnaire structure, individual diagnostic outputs
- **No benchmarking at collection** - Rankings, averages, and comparisons happen only post-diagnosis (if at all)

### Diagnostic Philosophy

- **Focus on operational reality, not software wishes** - Understand current pain, not desired features
- **Map the complete value chain** - From first client contact to final payment collection
- **Reveal hidden costs** - Identify rework, manual processes, and time leaks
- **Professional, respectful tone** - Attorneys are experts; questions should honor their expertise

## Questionnaire Structure

The diagnostic questionnaire is organized by the law firm's operational journey. Each section reveals specific operational risks, inefficiencies, or cost drivers.

### Section 1: Client Acquisition & Intake

**Objective**: Identify bottlenecks in lead capture, qualification, and onboarding.

**Key Areas**:
- Lead source tracking and conversion visibility

**Sample Questions**:
- "How do you currently track where new client inquiries come from?"
- "What is your typical response time from initial contact to first consultation?"
- "Describe your conflict check process. How long does it typically take?"
- "How many people must approve an engagement letter before it's sent to the client?"
- "Where is client information initially recorded, and how many times is it re-entered?"
